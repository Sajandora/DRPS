# Disaster Response Preparedness System
## Introduction
Modern society faces various forms of disasters, including natural disasters, human-caused incidents, and social disasters. Natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and floods, which are increasing in frequency due to climate change, along with human-caused and social disasters like fires and terrorism, threaten our safety. In these disaster situations, providing prompt and accurate information and guidance on how to respond is crucial to minimizing damage.

The Ministry of the Interior and Safety developed and released an app called **[안전디딤돌](https://www.mois.go.kr/frt/sub/a06/b11/safetyStep/screen.do)** on November 26, 2012[^id1]. However, according to the recent 28th release notes[^id2], there have been 12 updates labeled simply as "action guidelines updates," with only 2 bug fixes and 1 security update, and no UI/UX improvements.

Despite the 2 bug fixes, reviews on the Play Store and App Store[^id3] still indicate numerous bugs and the need for UI improvements.

In light of these issues, this project aims to improve upon the existing '안전디딤돌' app by addressing its inconveniences and adding features such as real-time disaster status updates. By doing so, users will be able to **check the real-time disaster status** and receive **prompt guidance on how to respond** in each situation, contributing to **national development**.
